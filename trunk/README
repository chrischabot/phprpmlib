in PHP as a proof of concept, and as study project.

                   binary types propery
RPMLead.php      : Reads in the RPM lead information (mostly depreciated info, 
                   use header info instead)
RPMSignature.php : Reads the signature of the RPM
RPMIndex.php     : RPM index reading & parsing
RPMIndexEntry    : Class instanced by RPMIndex
RPMHeader.php    : RPM Header reading & parsing
RPM.php          : demo file, change /path/to/some/file.rpm to a real rpm file,
                   and run to see all the info collected
